# Topic-Modelling-using-LDA-NMF-and-Article-Recommendation

In this project we are going to propose a system with two components one is topic modelling and
the other is article recommendation. The first component of our project will have a text preprocessing part which will prepare our articles for the modelling phase. The second component
of our project is an article recommendation system that can compare documents in our corpus
and compare them with a given article or word to find the most similar articles to the given input.
This will use the tf-idf scores of tokens in all the articles and generate the term-term correlation
matrix. Finally using this our system will rank the documents in the corpus and give the 10 most
relevant documents to the given input.
